# **git Assignment**
### *What I Know About git*
* **README** files are for explanation
* README.**txt** files only contain text, nothing else
* README.**md** files can contain images as well as text; good for simple slideshows/presentations
* a repository is a folder that stores all the files
* a *local* repository is a copy of the repository downloaded on the computer (any changes are pushed to the server)
* **markdown** is a way to make the text fancier with **bold**, *italics*, ~~strikethroughs~~, headers, lists, links, and *most importantly code*

### *Questions*
* How is this used for code? What will we use it for?
* Do programmers in the real world use git?
* **What's the difference between *git desktop* and *git in the browser*?**
